Let's try to build a __decision tree__ with \n- y = car is from USA (origin = 1) or not (origin = 2 or 3) \n- X = horsepower and weight\n\nFor this we will \n\n- create a new y variable called (US) taking value of 1 if car is from USA and 0 if otherwise\n\nUsing the above data we can build a decision tree easily using the `sklearn` module\n\nThe model has an __accuracy score__ of $\\approx 0.80$. Note that we could easily improve the score by loosing some the restrictions on building the tree (here: max_depth). However, doing this will lead to significant overfitting. \n\nNow let's extend this example by building a __bagging classifier__ using $B$ decision trees.\n\nFor each $b=1, 2, \\ldots, B$  we need to:\n\n- take a bootstrap sample\n\n- train (i.e. fit) a decision tree model to the sampled data\n\nOnce we have done this we have $B$ trained decision trees. We can than calculate prediction for each of the $B$ trees and aggregate the prediction to one overall prediction. \n\nLet's build a bagging function for classification step by step. \n\nThe function should\n\n- take $X$, $y$ and $B$ as input \n\n- return $B$ fitted models and their scores as output\n\n\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":false,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"jupyter"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":true,"code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["../../styles.css"],"toc":true,"output-file":"S12_Ensembles.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"de","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.269","theme":"cosmo","page-layout":"full"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
